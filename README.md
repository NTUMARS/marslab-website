## 🔧 Configuration

### Site Settings

Edit `site.config.json` to update:
- Site title and description
- Social media links
- Navigation menu

### Astro Configuration

Edit `astro.config.ts` for:
- Base URL and deployment settings
- Build configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file for environment-specific settings.

## 👥 Managing People

Edit `src/data/people.ts` to add, remove, or update lab members:

```typescript
{
  name: "Person Name",
  position: "PhD Student",
  image: "/people/person.jpg",
  bio: "Short bio...",
  research: "Research interests...",
  links: {
    website: "https://...",
    email: "email@example.com",
    scholar: "https://scholar.google.com/...",
    github: "https://github.com/..."
  }
}
```

Profile images go in `public/people/`.

## 📝 Managing Publications

Publications are managed as markdown files in `src/content/publications/en/`.

Each publication file should include frontmatter with:
- title
- authors
- venue
- year
- links (paper, project page, etc.)

New publications can be added by the authors via pull request. Steps are the following:
- Create a personal fork of the repo
- Update the remote to track the original repo as upstream (`git remote add upstream git@github.com:Embodied-Minds-Lab/embodied-minds-lab.github.io`)
- Create a new branch `git checkout -b new_pub`
- Update your new publication (create a new `.md` file with a unique identifier, and add a corresponding gif or image) 
- Run locally to confirm there are no issues
- Publish the PR and notify an administrator

## 🚀 Deployment

The site is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions when changes are pushed to the `main` branch.

### Manual Deployment

1. Build the site: `npm run build`
2. Deploy the `dist/` directory to your hosting platform
